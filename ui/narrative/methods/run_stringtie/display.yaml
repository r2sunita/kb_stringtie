parameters :
  alignment_object_ref :
    ui-name : |
        Reads Alignment or Reads AlignmentSet 
    short-hint : |
        Select the RNASeqAlignment or AlignmentSet created by HISAT2, TopHat2 or Bowtie2.
  mode:
    ui-name : |
        StringTie mode
    short-hint: |
        Running stringtie in ['normal', 'merge', 'novel-isoform'] mode. 
        Normal mode: Running stringtie once with -eB options enabled.
        Merge mode: Running stringtie to generate merged gtf and filter unknown features from reference genome. Then running stringtie again using filtered merge gtf.
        Novel Isoform mode: Running stringtie to generate merged gtf and then run stringtie again using this merged gtf. No workspace object will be created. Only choose this option to get Novel Isoforms.
  expression_suffix :
    ui-name : |
        Expression Name Suffix
    short-hint : |
        Provide a suffix for the individual expression output object name
  expression_set_suffix :
    ui-name : |
        ExpressionSet Name Suffix
    short-hint : |
        Provide a suffix for the expression set output object name
  min_isoform_abundance :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Isoform Abundance
    short-hint : |
      Set the minimum isoform abundance of the predicted transcripts as a fraction of the most abundant transcript assembled at a given locus. Lower abundance transcripts are often artifacts of incompletely spliced precursors of processed transcripts. Default: 0.1. 
  junction_base :
    ui-name : |
      Filter Junctions 
    short-hint : |
      Junctions that don't have spliced reads that align across them with at least this amount of bases on both sides are filtered out. Default is 10.
  min_length :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Length
    short-hint : |      
      Select minimum length for predicted transcripts. Default is 200.
  junction_coverage :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Spliced Reads
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum spliced reads to align across a junction. Default is 1.
  min_read_coverage :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Read Coverage
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum read coverage allowed for predicted transcripts. Default is 2.5.
  min_locus_gap_sep_value :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Locus Gap
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum locus gap separation value. Default is 50.

    <p>This App assembles transcripts for an individual Alignment or an AlignmentSet using StringTie so that you can view the relative abundances of the assembled transcripts in a histogram. </p>
    <p>StringTie is a successor of Cufflinks that is faster and provides more accurate reconstruction of genes and expression level. It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads from HISAT2, TopHat2 or Bowtie2 and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>
    <p>The StringTie output object contains GTF (transcripts.gtf) and FPKM (genes.fpkm_tracking) files. The GTF file contains annotated transcripts assembled by StringTie whereas the FPKM file provides the normalized expression matrix objects (abundance of each transcript expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) and transcripts per kilobase million (TPM)). The StringTie Table Histogram tab displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value in both log2(FPKM+1) and log2(TPM+1).</p>
    <p>The StringTie output object can be used to identify differential expression either using DESeq2, Cuffdiff or Ballgown.</p>
    <p>This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone.</p>
